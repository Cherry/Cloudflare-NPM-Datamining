<h4>About Product Management at Cloudflare</h4>
<p>As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you will be responsible for building products and workflows that help us improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, collaborate with other PMs, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation.</p>
<h4>About the role</h4>
<p>As the Product Manager for the Productivity Platform, your primary goal is to help improve the efficiency and happiness of internal development teams through enhancements to platform infrastructure (such as the backend for our design system) and developer tooling. You’ll work closely with a strong team of Engineers to build tools and processes to make our engineers’ lives better.</p>
<p>You’ll be responsible for the long-term strategy, roadmap, and delivery of a variety of platforms and tools that enable a good developer experience at Cloudflare. You’ll essentially be building the productivity and engineering tools that we use to deliver products to customers. To put it another way: you will give developers the firepower they need to improve the ~20% of the web that runs on Cloudflare products. This includes areas such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Infrastructure for our design system and UI components. You will pioneer new techniques and tooling to move away from a traditional monolithic application and onto Cloudflare's innovative <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/fragment-piercing/">Web Fragments</a>. You will also help set best practices, evangelize changes across engineering teams, and ensure adoption.</li>
	<li>Champion building “Cloudflare on Cloudflare”. We are serious about using our own customer-facing developer platform for internal use, and improving those tools through dogfooding.</li>
	<li>Developer productivity, developer Insights/SDLC, developer Infrastructure (GitLab, Bitbucket, TeamCity, etc), and release pipeline tooling.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Competencies</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Customer Engagement: Engage directly with internal customers (primarily systems engineers) to deeply understand their needs. You will be the voice of their needs within this team, ensuring that our productivity platform products are continuously evolving to meet these needs.</li>
	<li>Market Understanding: Keep up to date on industry trends to ensure Cloudflare remains a leader in providing a great developer experience for our teams.</li>
	<li>Product Strategy and Vision: Define and drive the strategic direction for Cloudflare's productivity platform, aligning with broader company objectives and customer needs.</li>
	<li>Cross-Functional Partnership: Collaborate with engineering, design, and other product teams to understand user and business needs, and deliver a developer experience that is valuable and works within the constraints of our business.</li>
	<li>Data-Informed Decision Making: Use data analytics to inform product decisions and measure the impact of new features and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bonus Points</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Understanding of modern developer tooling with enough fidelity to hold your own with engineers will be highly beneficial. An engineering background would be helpful. An alternate source of credibility on this front might come from having developed a web property yourself.</li>
	<li>Experience with thoughtfully using Generative AI to meaningfully improve the developer experience and increase developer efficiency and code quality.</li>
	<li>Experience designing and running highly available systems that deal with data and traffic at massive scale.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>At Cloudflare it’s pretty helpful to understand how the Internet really works at layers 2 through 7. If you don’t have this, be prepared to speak with mastery about another realm of similar complexity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Colorado-based hires: Estimated annual salary of $140,000 - $172,000.</span></p>
